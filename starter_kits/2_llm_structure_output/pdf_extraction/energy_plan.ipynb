      "\n",
      "#### **Common Energy Policy Goals**  \n",
      "- **Reduce energy consumption** and costs across tribal buildings.  \n",
      "- **Improve occupant comfort** and building safety.  \n",
      "- **Guide future retrofit projects** through energy audits and data monitoring.  \n",
      "- **Enhance community engagement** via outreach (presentations, flyers, videos).  \n",
      "- **Secure funding/training** for long-term sustainability.  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Most Comprehensive Plans**  \n",
      "- **Aniak** and **Akiachak** stand out for detailed actions:  \n",
      "  - Both include energy audits, maintenance checklists, training, and quarterly reporting.  \n",
      "  - Akiachak explicitly seeks financing for retrofits, while Aniak emphasizes coordination with regional projects.  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Unique or Innovative Actions**  \n",
      "- **Atmautluak**: Interviews with experts to refine energy action plans.  \n",
      "- **Kwigillingok**: Outreach via video, a less common method in other plans.  \n",
      "- **Akiachak**: Monthly maintenance checklists (more frequent than others).  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Main Differences in Stakeholders and Timelines**  \n",
      "- **Stakeholders**:  \n",
      "  - All involve tribes, CCHRC, Energy Audits of Alaska, and Nuvista Electric.  \n",
      "  - **Atmautluak** uniquely includes \"Alaskans\" broadly; **Akiachak** specifies building occupants.  \n",
      "- **Timelines**:  \n",
      "  - Most focus on **2017–2018**, with quarterly reports.  \n",
      "  - **Atmautluak** extends to **February 2019** for final review.  \n",
      "  - **Akiachak** mentions ongoing maintenance beyond 2018.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### **Key Takeaways**  \n",
      "- Shared goals of efficiency, cost reduction, and comfort.  \n",
      "- Aniak and Akiachak have the most structured plans.  \n",
      "- Outreach and stakeholder engagement vary slightly by region.  \n",
      "- Timelines are similar, but Atmautluak has a later review phase.\n"

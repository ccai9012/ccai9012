      "Based on the provided policy tables for the Alaskan communities of Aniak, Kwigillingok, and Atmautluak, here is a comparative summary.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Common Energy Policy Goals\n",
      "The communities share nearly identical primary objectives, focusing on practical, immediate improvements to building efficiency and energy management.\n",
      "*   **Improve Building Condition:** All plans prioritize assessing and upgrading the physical state of buildings, including insulation, siding, and safety.\n",
      "*   **Decrease Energy Use:** A universal goal is to reduce consumption of fuel and electricity to lower costs and increase sustainability.\n",
      "*   **Data-Driven Planning:** Each project emphasizes the critical role of collecting and analyzing baseline data (e.g., from energy bills and building surveys) to inform future retrofit projects and measure success.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Regions with the Most Comprehensive Plans\n",
      "While all plans are focused, Atmautluak's project outline is the most structured and comprehensive.\n",
      "*   **Atmautluak** has a clearly defined, multi-step process that moves from initial meetings and data collection to creating, reviewing, and finalizing a formal Energy Action Plan. This indicates a strategic approach to long-term energy management.\n",
      "*   **Aniak** also demonstrates a strong, ongoing monitoring component with specific tasks like monthly energy bill analysis, making its plan operationally detailed.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Unique or Innovative Actions Mentioned\n",
      "The actions are largely centered on foundational audits and retrofits, with one notable exception.\n",
      "*   **Standard Actions:** Most key actions are standard for energy efficiency projects: building surveys, energy bill analysis, LED lighting upgrades, and installing setback thermostats.\n",
      "*   **Innovative Action:** **Kwigillingok** mentions the unique and ambitious goal of providing electricity and heat via wind turbines, which is a significant step towards renewable energy generation rather than just efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Summary of Main Differences in Stakeholders and Timelines\n",
      "The main differences lie in the specificity of timelines and the inclusion of technical partners.\n",
      "*   **Stakeholders:** All involve tribal leadership (IRA Council/Traditional Council), project staff, and occupants. The key difference is the explicit involvement of technical research partners like the **Cold Climate Housing Research Center (CCHRC)** in Aniak and Atmautluak, which adds a layer of expertise not mentioned for Kwigillingok.\n",
      "*   **Timelines:** This is the area of greatest variation. **Atmautluak** has a specific start point (May 2018). **Aniak** outlines ongoing, periodic tasks (monthly analysis) and a mid-2019 publication date. **Kwigillingok's** plan lacks a defined timeline altogether.\n"

"I was really between 3 and 4 stars for this one. I LOVE the 96th street Naked Tchopstix so I was very excited to see this one which is closer to my house. The vibe is totally different as this is geared more to take out although they do have a decent size dining area. You order at the counter and they deliver it. My daughter and I tried the sushi bowl. You pick up a piece of paper and  select from a choice of proteins, vegetables, rice and toppings. I like the fact that it is on paper and you don't have to guess what things are or have to shout over the counter to tell the server what you want. The sushi bowl was good but not wonderful. The choices particularly of the vegetables seemed a little too limiting and I felt I had more rice than other food items. The sauces were tasty. My husband ordered the Maui roll which is my favorite roll at the 96th street location and this just was not up that standard. It was good but the quality and consistently was not as good as at 96th street. I would go back though and I think a lot of people would be happy with the sushi bowls. I do want to make a comment about the low reviews that people have given the place because of service. People - it is a sushi place - it isn't McDonalds- so it will be a bit slower. You are not going to order and get out of there in five minutes even though it is called express. As a healthy alternative to fast food in the area, it is worth the wait. Oh and try the bubble tea. I had the strawberry and it was quite yummy. Next time I am going to try the vanilla chai.",positive,content,"sushi bowl, Maui roll, bubble tea",4.0,Naked Tchopstix Express,39.912505,-86.211285
"I love the Brewpub for their variety of dishes.  Nachos, pizza and sandwiches.  Variety of beers to choose from crafted right on sight.    Every time we go, the service is slow.  I think it's just the pace of the restaurant.  It's never a quick beer and a bite of food.  Instead, enjoy the patio and friends, savor that time.    Kid and dog friendly environment.  Also great for your vegetarian and vegan friends.    My go to is a half order of the nachos or fish & chips.    Tried their Pumpkin Seasonal Beer and it's on par with some of my favorite pumpkins.",positive,content,"variety of dishes, slow service, kid and dog friendly",4.0,Broad Ripple Brewpub,39.8735797809,-86.142783297
I stopped here because it was by the hotel I was staying in. The guys working at the shop were super nice and friendly. I really like the buy one get one deal they do.

"Milktooth is the place to go if you want a good breakfast cocktail and a twist on traditional brunch. At first glance of the menu, you may think you've never heard of any of these foods for breakfast, and you may be right. I guarantee no matter what you order, you're going to enjoy it.   Milktooth is one of the most popular brunch places in Indy, which means you will typically have a wait. Trust me, it's worth the usual 30 minute wait (on weekends). To make it go by a little faster, they've got a walk up bar for their coffee drinks and pastries. Snack on one of those to give you a preview of the amazing meal you're about to have.  Their menu changes from time to time but they have a few things that stay one the menu but change ingredients. I love all of their variations on a Dutch pancake, and their raclette grilled cheese is to die for.  If you're making this a boozy breakfast, don't pass up on the michelada. And sit outside if it's warm enough!",positive,delighted,"breakfast cocktail, brunch, wait, Dutch pancake, michelada",5.0,Milktooth,39.7591692208,-86.146494347
"I typically do my laundry at my boyfriend's house, but I had family who recently stayed with me and had a bunch of towels, sheets, and comforters to wash.  I was searching for a laundry mat that would be safe, clean and not full of questionable people.  I was so happy to find this facility.  It is clean, well-lit, and the staff is so friendly and helpful.  I was amazed at the speed of the laundry and dryer.  I completed 4 oversize loads ( probably equal to 8 regular loads) in just under 2 hours!  This place has security cameras, flat screen T.V's, magazines, wi-fi, clean bathrooms, vending machines.  It is a wonderful atmosphere to do your laundry.  It was not overly busy, there are plenty of washers and dryers.  I am so happy that I found this place.

I've been to many art museums and was surprised to see a museum this beautiful with such a great collection to be FREE! I was so happy to have had discovered this museum in my short time in Indianapolis.

"My sister-in-law and I visited this restaurant on 8/28/15 mid afternoon.  We were seated after requested 3 times that the hostess speak a little louder because we couldn't even hear her with the background music.  We were seated in a booth with a never ending Larry King vitamin commercial on the TV - really?  Our waitress introduced herself and a new trainee and then we never saw her again.  Two other wait staff seemed to be sharing our table, but no idea who was responsible for our table.  We got our drinks and ordered, but food took forever considering there was not more than 15-20 filled tables in the entire restaurant.  Burgers were not bad - I ordered the blue cheese burger and it would have been better with less blue cheese, way too much!  Fries and onion sticks were very good.  But no one came to see if we were satisfied, needing anything, etc and took two requests and waiting to get a carry out box.  There was a family seated across the aisle from us when we arrived and we assumed they had finished their meal and were ""hanging out"".  Only after we received our food did we understand they had already ordered and still did not have their food!  I doubt I will return to this restaurant in the future.",negative,frustrated,"service, waiting time, food quality",2.0,Cheeseburger in Paradise,39.664583,-86.089236
"In short, the food was decently good, but completely overpriced.  The guacamole and my Mojito were probably the highlight of the meal. I had the peach pork medallions, which were nicely cooked, but lacked flavor. I tried the corn cakes with Barbacoa and that was pretty good.    The atmosphere was inviting with a hip feel if that's what you're looking for.  What was really annoying was the parking situation. For a place with price points such as these and limited parking spaces, a valet service should be provided either at a cost or complimentary.  Don't even try and park in the back of the building, it's tight and dangerous even getting there and back.

"Stopped in on a Monday around 7pm and the place was pretty full.  The bartender was friendly and attentive.  The bar seemed well stocked, not a drinker so take that as you will.  Now the food...THE FOOD was fantastic!  I ordered the Pear Gorgonzola Melt.  How they fit all that amazingness on one plate is impressive.  The clientele is all ages and backgrounds, which is great.

The is a greek owned pancake house (hence the over doing it on naming the food) and is a great alternative to your larger chain pancake houses such as Robert Evans, IHopity hop, and Mr. Dennys.   We eat here every new years day, typically around 2 pm when we drag ourselves out of a drunken slumber to brave the bitter cold. They never have a problem seating our group of about 12-15 and are pleasant and quick service.   The energetic owner likes to roam around making sure everything is going well.

"Last time:  This is the second and last time my wife and I visit this place.  We were the ONLY table, yet it took the waitress at least 15 minutes to get our order.  From then our pizzas took about 45 minutes (they were both small).  While waiting for our pizza I had to move us to the bar are a.  I couldn't stand listening to one of the other waitresses bitching about the place non-stop while our waitress was sweeping.  Her bitching was amplified in that echo chamber.

"My boyfriend and I decided to stop by for lunch yesterday, and I am so glad we did. I ordered a side of beans, chips and salsa, and guacamole. He ordered two steak tacos and a side of rice. The beans are hands down my favorite I've had from a mexican restaurant.  My only complaint is that, unfortunately you do not get a very big portion. The salsa is so fresh tasting and delicious-very cilantro forward, and the chips were nice, thick and crunchy without being oily at all. Take note though, chips and salsa are not included with your purchase and must be bought separately. Now let me get to the best part-the made to order, chunky guacamole. The hardy chips would definitely withstand this heavy duty guac, but I opted instead for tortillas as my vessel to stuff it with along with my beans and salsa. The hot sauces were anything but, though admittedly my tolerance to spices may be higher than the average persons. While I had a great eating experience, my boyfriend did not. He said the meat was of low quality and quite flavorless.

"If you are going for the food, I would give it 5 stars, but since this is a brewhouse, I only gave it 3.   I ordered the light flight since we went for lunch and I wasn't looking for a heavy meal. The beer was OK at best. It was bland, a little strange in after taste and uninspired. Light beers dont have to equal tasteless. My boyfriend had a ""hoppy beer with citrus undertones"". He could taste neither the hops or the citrus  (disclaimer - we are from VT and are used to very hoppy beers!)    Now the food - that was great. We went at lunch time and was able to get a soup and salad for 8.95. We both had the same thing - Chicken Bruchetta salad and French Onion Soup.

"So, I went back to El Arado on Monday with a group of six people. The staff seemed shocked about our 6 pm arrival, and ""sanitized"" a large table for us quickly. Yes, the table smelled like dirty sanitized rags, ugh, but, once you got buzzed on...I mean beyond, the smell, your waiter will appear and take your drink orders.   We got beers and margaritas. The margarita drinker in the group declared that it ""was good.""  The prices for drinks weren't that bad.  ($2.95 for Mexican beers).   We all ordered our food, which was brought out at a good time, fresh, and hot. Everyone snarfed - it was good and tasty and all our needs were met attentively by the quiet waiter.   All of us were let satisfied, and our specific requests (i.e. ""no beans"" ""light on the cheese"") were met by the kitchen staff with no problems. We left with full bellies then went to the Red Garter for a mind-numbing strip club experience.   What a way to wrap up a review..

"I recently moved in a few blocks away from Henry's and was looking forward to having a neighborhood coffee spot not far from my house. So, on a beautifully humid August morning I walked over to check it.   1) The atmosphere is pretty standard. Open space with the coffee bar in the back left corner and ordinary tables and chairs scattered throughout. No college coffee shop couches or armchairs but no industrial airbnb chic vibe either. Lacked uniqueness.   2) The name Henry reminds me of Thomas the tank engine. Was there a train named Henry on there or not? If so, was he chill or not. Could add one star for chill train association.   3) The coffee was not good. I got an iced coffee (STFU) and it was super bitter. The amount of ice in it wasn't obscene so it had that going for it but other than that idk.

"If you are visiting Indianapolis, I highly suggest this hotel. My boyfriend and I went just for one night and used his AAA discount which saved us a lot. They have a parking structure attached to the hotel for $20 a night. Starting at the garage they had such cool urban art that continue throughout our stay. The check in was an easy process and the service was amazing. Everywhere you turn there is another interesting piece of art work to look at. Our room was very nice, keurig coffee machine,large luxurious shower, comfy robes, and comfortable california king. We had tickets to the Pacers game which worked out perfectly. We had drinks and dinner before the game at Plat 99 which is in the hotel- again more great decor. They had a whole timeline of cocktails and complementary truffle popcorn. (they also had a really cool outdoor rooftop seating area for the bar, but was too cold and snowy to go out on) Bankers Field house was maybe 1 minute away walking. After the game we came back and got some drinks at Plat 99 again, it was pretty crowded, fun environment. For breakfast we ate at the Market Place downstairs, it was one set price for a buffet and had a lot of good food.  We checked out at 11am- very easy and the concierge was friendly and helpful. Before we left we spent about 30 minutes just walking around the hotel looking at all the art work, it is like a modern art museum.

"Have only been once a couple of months ago, so maybe this was a one-off experience...Ordered a piece of carrot cake, which tasted fine. Certainly not the best I've ever had but good enough. The to go packaging was a bit overkill just for that one slice of cake, as was the $10 price tag. That being said, I'm sure the ""fanciness"" of the place is what makes it so appealing to folks. It really is quite unique and cute for our area and would be a good place to go with the gals (rather than my husband who hates all things trendy, lol).   My problem, though, was with the service. We placed our order for the carrot cake with a nice young teenager, and then waited. And waited. I could see the carrot cake just sitting in the pretty covered cake stand, and I felt really tempted to just slice it myself. After a bit (felt like 10 minutes, although I'm sure it was more like 5 or 6), another employee came and sliced the carrot cake, setting the slice on the back counter with the ticket. And then we waited. And waited some more. After about another 5 to 10 minutes, I flagged the teenager down and asked if he could box up the cake for us. He seemed confused, and it took an awkward minute-long exchange for him to understand we hadn't yet received our order. He did apologize for the wait, which I do appreciate, boxed up the cake, and then we were on our way.  I should clarify that we did not go into the shop at a busy time. It was a relatively cool day and not many people were out. While there were maybe 2 to 3 tables seated, we were the only ones at the counter ordering. And while I'm sure the wait staff who repeatedly walked by our lonely piece of carrot cake sitting on the back counter had many important tasks...I just wanted to eat my $10 cake.

However, bier rotates their taps weekly and does not seem to have any regular taps, I like this because it means that they are constantly challenging themselves to create a better beer.

"I've been to New Day Meadery quite a few times, and every time I come I'm never disappointed! Normally when I come here I order the South Cider or the Shelby Blue Ribbon, but on my last trip I decided to taste one of their seasonal items. I tasted the Paulding Light which has cranberry, honey, and a touch of lime. It was pretty good, but was not as sweet as Shelby Blue Ribbon in my opinion. But that is what I like about New Day, they always have a variety of meads and ciders that everyone can enjoy, not just sugar fans like myself.

Nice new burger spot downtown! They are apart of the harry & izzys chain. The burgers are pretty good. You do have to order a side separately which kinda sticks but seems to be a trend these days. They take reservations so that's always a plus. If you are looking for additional options besides a burger might not be your best spot to go. I'd like to see them do a lunch special during the week for those that go during the work day. I think it would help with costs and getting a bigger lunch crowd. Overall great experience and service.

The beer is pretty good.  I wish they would do some more adventurous offerings, but I can still get a good beer here.   The food can be a mixed bag.  I had a small pizza that was a gooey mess (mushrooms and hearty toppings need a thick crust for stability).  I love all the scotch egg offerings (you can get it on a pizza or burger here), but they are so salty.  The burgers are good. The desserts are great (please get the frangipane).

"As much as I adore food I am, typically, pretty easy when it comes to food and I forgive a lot. SO...one star means a lot! I haven't been as livid as I was leaving this fiasco of a restaurant in a long while. Reasons:  The server was on her cell phone from the minute we walked in to the minute we walked out (about 90 minutes). She literally had it on her shoulder the entire time except to say, ""Please hold"" to take our orders. She was also the chef and cooked while talking on her bloody phone, as well. Service:  FAIL. My pork leg was tender and good which constitutes the lonely little star you see above. My husband ordered the shrimp, which cost $18.99. He received 7 shrimp that would be in a bag of 31-35 count...the size worthy of a salad shrimp. Again, $18.99...and the plantain portion of the meal consisted of 2 plantains the width of a postage stamp. Ridiculous. I then ordered tostones because I knew he would never be full with that quantity of food. I had to get up and find our server to add to my order as she was nowhere to be found.  They were also ridiculously thin, were over salted with an almost breaded and deep fried consistency. Food:  FAIL. I was going to order a Cuban coffee but the server was so non-existent that I just gave up, finally.  In retrospect, I'm happy I didn't order it because I'm sure it would have been just wrong.

You may be surprised at all the books they have that you didn't even know you wanted. They also have a small selection of new books. If they don't have what you're looking for, you can order it. The one thing I don't really like is that the $1 children's books can be jammed so tightly that it's hard to look through them.

"It is typical Broad Ripple charming spot. Small, trendy and bustling with activity. They do not take reservations. Which is somewhat annoying when you are traveling from another part of town. Whatever, we just had to arrange to arrive earlier than we would have liked to hopefully secure a table, which we did. When we arrived it was quiet and only several tables had guests seated. As our dinner progressed it became more crowded until every seat was filled. Nice lively scene except then you can not hear squat! It made dinner conversation difficult. Boo!!!! I think this could be an easy fix for them.   Meal/Drinks:  The cocktails were creative and tasted wonderful. Our servers suggestions were pretty spot on as we enjoyed most of her suggestions.   The guacamole was very good with the exception of the fact that my friend has a nut allergy and we asked to have them left off and of coarse they arrived with them on! They really weren't necessary in my opinion either as I don't think they add much to the dish. The reason I wanted to try this restaurant- The Harvest salad! We all split this as well and it was good. The combination of fruit and root vegetables was delish! The figs were so good and the herbed goat cheese mouse was a highlight on this plate!  Two of us ordered the Veracruz Trigger fish and the other ordered the Serrano Scallops and all of it was wonderful. The white sweet mashed potatoes were interesting! I am glad we tried them. The Veracruz sauce was wonderful and full of flavor. It was a lot of food though. Had we known we would have probably skipped one of the first course selections or split an entree. That'a ok though- lunch for today :)  We also tried the Tostones and Stewed Black Beans. Beans were very good, full of flavor! Tostones seemed very dry but maybe that is what they are supposed to be- this is the first time I have had them. BUT, dipped in the Stewed Black Beans they tasted great!  We passed on dessert as they had no gluten free, dairy free options. Delicia offers many options for restricted diets, which we loved.

"Its a rarity that i give five stars for anything. But in comparing this tattoo shop to the others around Indy and how they've jacked me around i decided its simply worth it to give 5. The other places have cancelled on me at the last moment, even when i was en route to go get the tattoo, one guy didnt even remember me when i called the day before to make sure we were on schedule for the tat and yet another had the inks set out and asked me to sit down when he got a call that he needed to go pick up the kids at school - all of these places i scheduled months out in advance as well. So, here we are back at Metamorphosis where they actually like to run a business the way it should be. Honestly i have only had one tat done here by Trevor and at the time it was the most fun 4 hour rib tattoo experience i could have had. They act professional, not like the rock star wanna be's i tried to check out at other places. Just cool chill people who want your business here. Trevor gave me the tattoo i wanted in the place i wanted it even though i feel he would have given me honest advice if it were needed. When it came time to get the tat, he held his appointment and i was treated with respect and as though a customer should be treated. Honestly i dont think this place cost more than any other place where youll get good work. Prices are about average in my opinion for the quality of work done. Dont waste your time going to the other places and getting jerked around - ive already done the work for you. Its a shame too that they may have good artwork at other places but youll feel like less of a human going anywhere else. The artists are just as good here and youll be respected for your $.

A friend and I went spur of the moment and I'm glad we did. From the outside of the building you wouldn't know it was a hookah bar (except the giant sign of course lol). The moment you open that giant wooden door, the decor and paint color gives it that authentic look. Warm yellow paint with evil eyes and giant metal wall lamps with cutouts shining red surrounding all the walls. When you go up a few steps there's a gift shop, a table, and the register. They ask you to take a seat upstairs and they follow you shortly after. (There's even another upstairs that I barely peaked at). This is the amazing part: cushions on the floor with giant metal mandala tables!!!! It was so authentic I could barely handle my excitement. They have a menu with drinks, food and hookah. Water was only a dollar which was amazing because hookah bars are usually pretty pricy. We smoked ""sex on the beach"" flavored shisha. It was smooth! Very smooth! We even brought bubbles for the trip to have a little fun :) What I like about this place compared to other loud hookah bars is that it wasn't even close to being hectic. I felt like I should have whispered at first, but after awhile I was more comfortable. Only one other couple was there and they were very nice to talk to as well.

What I assume must have been cream cheese filling in the middle was decadent and I never wanted the cake to end. ***I felt one slice was plenty for two people, it's HUGE  I was torn between the Rose Cappuccino and the Lavender Latte. I went with the Lavender Latte, hot, and it was stunning, it was a creamy, smooth, not-at-all bitter latte and the hint of lavender was enough to taste but not over powering, it was probably the most perfect coffee I've ever had in my life.   Price: the coffee is pricy, $6, so not a regular coffee stop for me, but for #treatyoself it's the way to go. The slice of cake was $12 but like I mentioned, it was enough for two people and for how amazing it was, I think it's so worth it.  Customer Service: I mentioned Disney initially because the friendliness, care, and attention of the staff felt just like Disney. They were kind, they helped me decide what to try, and the barista even offered to make me the rose cappuccino if I didn't like the lavender latte after trying it - how sweet!   I will most definitely think to come here if anyone visits and wants something sweet. This place has my heart and is a hidden gem to anyone who has a sweet tooth!

Usually we take home half our sandwiches to eat for a second meal, but I just wasnt ready to stop eating for the night, so alas, I dont have another meal. Guess I'll just have to go back!   And the company was just as inviting. We chatted with Diana (Dayana?), for quite a while after we ate, and she told us how she and her dad opened the restuarant, and how it really is a labor of love.   Try it out.

Everything is presented beautifully; do not expect that an entree will stuff you here or that the accompaniments are full ""side"" portions.

Since the sandwiches were cut in half we shared those too so each of us could have both flavors. We liked them both but agreed the grilled pork, which does have a brown sauce of some sort, was better.  Afterward I wanted something sweet so I ordered a strawberry smoothie to go. I asked for *some* bubbles because i wanted to try them but didn't want my drink full of them. Overall it was good but SUCH a sugar bomb.  The guy running the place was very nice, too.

"They lose a star for having TWO STORES on essentially the same road...one on the far northeast side and one on the far northwest side. Really, Trader Joe? Your stores are all over the place in other cities, like Chicago, DC, San Francisco......but southside Indy gets ZERO...downtown Indy NONE. That's not cool, Joe. Not cool at all.   However, the employees are pretty useful and cool (and sometimes even funny). The food is affordable. I like that it doesn't take me 15 minutes to get through the store because it's petite. LOVE the products. Once I got a spoiled piece of salmon, and they cheerfully refunded me and I didn't have to bring back the gross fish. I like the free samples (last night I had a bite of pumpkin pie). LOVE that I can have a cheese party without going broke. Their low-budget beers and wines are fantastic for cooking and fairly passable for drinking if you need to buy in bulk and your friends aren't super snobby about booze.   Kefir, non-dairy milks, organic products, cheese are generally much cheaper here than at other grocery chains or gourmet stores. Their frozen foods are very good and the MorningStar Farms sausage links' everyday price is equivalent to the super sale price at other grocery stores.   I am particularly fond of the somewhat-strange party snacks, although they are much pricier than at Saraga.   Trader Joe's is a great place to find food to ""cheat"" with if you're not much of a cook or are pressed for time. For example, you can buy an already-seasoned tri-tip to use for your steak fajitas. You can find pre-marinated chicken to put on the grill. They also sell many pre-cooked foods that you just have to microwave...if you can't cook at all.   In conclusion, start writing letters, people! We need a downtown Trader Joe's!

"I tend to prefer local cupcake shops to fancy chains like Sprinkles, but unfortunately I must say that I prefer Sprinkles to The Flying Cupcakes. First, visually, the frosting-to-cupcake ratio is too small.  I like eating cake with frosting.  I don't want to eat too much of cake without frosting.  Second, I'm not a fan of having chocolate chips in my red velvet cake.  They overwhelm the flavor of cream cheese frosting.  Third, and this is the biggest negative, the frosting does not melt in the mouth!  It's too thick and hard, which means when you eat the cake with the frosting, they do not mash well in the mouth to give the goodness of all the flavors melted together. You might as well eat them separately.   I only tried their red velvet cupcake, and maybe their other flavors are better, but I think I make better cupcakes at home, and I have certainly had much better cupcakes from other stores.  I don't think they are worth my $3 or my time waiting in line.

Our desert was followed by the cheesy blue corn grits with all the extras (I.e. a soft poached egg, scallions and bacon bits). I'm late to the grits game but I loved them. My lovely wife had the bialy (think bagel) and lox, and miso soup. She is more of a foodie than me and a chef to boot. She was quite pleased. Service was average to good. It was cool sitting at the  counter. We got to watch the chefs in action. There was a taller female that was very focused and professional, more than most. When she wasn't cooking she was prepping and/or cleaning. Not sure why this wasn't a five star rating, probably the average service. In the end we had a great dining experience.

Absolutely awful pizza.  My fiancee and I ate there last night and ordered takeout.  First of I got to there to pick up my order and was ignored for about 15 minutes when I finally had to get somebody to get my order.  Once I got the pizza it was burned and black on the outside of the pizza and on the bottom.  I was able to eat about one piece of pizza because of how badly burned it was.  The pizza was barely chewable because of this.  Then last night both my fiancee and I felt sick after eating the pizza.

"I went to Milktooth over the weekend and I really wanted to love it but it was just okay.  I read through a few of the reviews before going and wasn't surprised that they were out of the fried chicken when I got there.  I wasn't planning on ordering it anyway but someone in my group tried to.    I ended up going with the lamb patty melt and while it was good...it wasn't great.  I love having an egg on my sandwich so that was a highlight.  The lamb wasn't that great and it tasted like they combined the lamb meat with some sort of sausage but it don't state so on the menu.   The french fries were good but nothing special.  The lamb stew was the other item I was considering getting so maybe it would be worth going back and trying that.    If you're a vegetarian you probably want to avoid this place all together because it's not very veggie friendly.  And don't think you can go and order something (like the waffle) without the bacon because your requests for revisions will be ""politely declined"" as it states on the menu.   I like that they tell you ahead of time but it doesn't seem like it would be a terrible thing to request that the cook doesn't sprinkle the bacon on top of the waffle.   They do have some very interesting drinks and I would consider going there to grab a coffee because the process for coffee seemed to be quite intricate.

The atmosphere is cozy but there's still decent seating, the staff is friendly and the menu is even a little out there for pub food--gouda melted over apples on ciabatta? Hmm.... I had an apple, candied walnut and feta salad. Don't be fooled by the fact that it's called ""salad""--it was more like dessert. They could lay off the candied walnuts and raspberry dressing a bit and this would be a lot better and healthier option. I tried my companion's pesto and mushroom sandwich and it was quite good (probably not healthy either). The thick spicy chips were yummy (possibly homemade?). I guess most people don't go to bars to get healthful food, but I sometimes like to mitigate the beer calories by choosing the less fatty-sounding pub fare. I think Old Point may be a better option for those situations.  And, regarding beer.... I drank London Pride, which was decent. I'm not really wowed by places that have Boddington's and Fat Tire on tap--these are mass-produced and -distributed beer, people! That said, it's better than Bud or Coors.   Overall, Chatham is a decent bar. I can see why some might be more smitten than I was--it manages to offer a bit more than your generic pub experience and that can go a long way in Indy.

"Silver in the City has some really nice jewelry.  They also have a lot of fun trinkets that would make good gifts--things like Better-Than-A-Boyfriend soap, snarky fridge magnets, and bacon flavored gum.  They also sell some locally made goods, such as purses made from the roof of the old RCA dome.  Somewhat surprisingly, they sell furniture as well.  The location is nice, right next to Starbucks on Mass Ave.  The reason I give it 3 stars is that it seems really overpriced.  I'm not a jewelry expert, so I can't comment on those prices.  They may be quite legitimate.  A lot of the jewelry is really beautiful, and made by artists.  But all of the gifty items cost at least twice what I would have expected.  There may be a reason for this that I'm not aware of--I do know that some items are printed on recycled paper and reused materials.  I respect that.

The presentation was pretty lackluster, but food doesn't need a fancy container or complicated presentation to be delicious, that's exactly what this was! This was some of the best food I've stumbled upon in Indianapolis. The drunken chicken was so flavorful with just just a tad of spice.

"Well I read the other reviews and I have to disagree, I found the store delightful and a welcome change from typical Goodwill. I talked to the young ladies working and said what a pleasant experience it was shopping there. They told me the items offered are taken from overstock that would typically be warehoused. They do not pull from existing merchandise at GWs but from items that would be warehoused because there is no room for them in the GW store. So for those who still wish to treasure hunt at GW this does not preempt that thrill.  For me, though, I liked that the items were somewhat more selective than a typical GW. I found three shirts which on any given day I would look at 3 different GWs around town and not find one. My total cost on them was $19.25. An Old Navy, Lee Rider and Tommy Bahama ($10 of the $19). For me it was more akin to consignment shopping and priced accordingly.   I definitely think it's worth a look on any given day. The store is very nice and it's a more pleasant shopping experience than most consignment shops.",positive,delighted,"shopping experience, selective items, reasonable pricing",4.0,Vintage Vogue by GW,39.8682676313,-86.1232091553

"Ok here's the deal - I REALLY wanted to like this place, especially with all of the great reviews.  It's not close to me but I made the trip because it is supposedly great!  Sadly it was underwhelming from the minute we walked in the door.  There were only a few customers, and the two waitresses were watching TV and barely acknowledged us.  One of them approached but didn't say anything, she just grabbed some menus and took us to a table.  She didn't ask for drink orders or anything, just brought us some waters without saying a word.    We selected several items from the sushi menu and waited for her to return.  And waited some more.  And some more.  Finally after about 10 minutes I got her attention and she came back and took my order sheet, again without saying a word.  The miso soup came out pretty quickly but it just wasn't great.  When the sushi arrived, I noticed it was only about half of our order.  I wasn't too worried about it though, because there was only one sushi chef behind the bar and it's not uncommon for places to bring out parts of your order over time.  Still, the service was just plain bad and I won't be back!",negative,frustrated,"service, sushi, waitresses",2.0,Sushi Bar,39.8694324,-86.1425102

I truly expected more from a burger place owned by St. Elmo's and Harry and Izzy.  The restaurant felt more like a sports bar with all the TVs on and the pop music blaring so loud it made it difficult to focus on my date.  I got the Stanford (turkey burger) and zucchini straws.  The straws where much better than my burger that lacked any real taste.  My date got the Going Greek (lamb burger) and loaded potato salad and once again the side was better than the burger.

"This is for the University (Faculty) Club's dining room, open mainly to members who are part of IUPUI's faculty and staff.  Menu here:  https://universityclub.iupui.edu/Reservations/Weekly-Menu  Excellent service; my sponsor took me and other staff visiting the school this summer, for a buffet lunch.  The waitstaff were prompt in filling our waters and inquiring about more plates, and also served us whenever we requested (we asked that 2 portions of the red velvet cake be split 3 ways, and the result was prompt and precise, with extra small plates).  She was cheery and interacted with us professionally, even if this wasn't (I don't think) a private sector job driven by Yelp reviews and employee performance surveys.  The menu itself feels as if it's trying to demonstrate global culinary awareness on a very limited budget.  A couple of salad-y items including cornbread salad, a lively green (spinach) salad, and 2 other choices, plus various dressings that did not come out of a generic commercial bottle.  A couple of starches then proteins including a savory-sweet tofu entry--it was like the spicy peanut butter tofu I make at home, but more breaded and gunky and thus less spicy; a ""kalbi"" meat thing which was sweet and savory, soy sauce style, and kinda clumpy, but tried to hit the Korean flavor profile; and a couple of other animal meat options (uh, fish?).  Some inventiveness for trying to do something for foodies in this very countrified and simultaneously urban environment, I guess.  Culinary diversity efforts are always appreciated, even if the textures were not excellent.  My guess is they're operating with limited funding and staff, but there's some smart guy or gal doing the menu design, trying to figure how to make this stuff onthe line in a way that doesn't taste mass produced, but that also doesn't violate their financial dictates.

"This was my first visit to 3 Sisters Cafe and I was not disappointed. I had just come out of a physical therapy appointment for my spouse down the road at Athletico and wanted a tasty, fast breakfast -- with FAST being the operative word here.   I took a chance on 3 Sisters and it really paid off. We were in and out of there with great service in about 35 minutes total. It's a small place with friendly servers. I had a classic breakfast: 2 eggs, toast, and bacon. This was called ""The Don"" and came with potatoes but they swapped the taters for bacon at no additional cost. What an unexpected surprise! Everything was cooked to perfection: eggs over medium, wheat toast perfectly toasted, and crispy bacon.   My husband ordered a ""half"" order of pancakes which was a single giant pancake that took up literally the entire platter. He also had a side order of eggs. The portions were so generous that he wasn't able to finish it all despite having just worked up an appetite from the physical therapy.   The only thing I wish I could change is the acoustics in the place. I love that it's a converted old cottage house, but the echoes of nearby diners is pretty disruptive. There were only 4 groups of people counting us and it was pretty loud. We considered moving to their nice outdoor dining area but it's 85 and humid so we stayed put.

The egg was so fluffy and savory while the crust was super flaky and had a great bacon flavor.  This was a perfect snack to split between 2 people and just hit the spot!  It was so hard to decide which cake to try. One gripe that I have about this place is the price of the cake slices. The slices are quite large and pricey. If you only come with 2 people it is hard to get a few things to share without either breaking the bank or stuffing your face with dessert. I asked if we could do 1/2 slices, but was politely denied. A suggestion I have would be to allow fractions of slices so people can try multiple different cakes.  My wife loves chocolate and I love all sweets so we opted for the famous chocolate cake.

Unless you planned on being robbed of thousands go somewhere else.  I've had continuous problems w a power steering on my impala for going on 2 years. 1st time they cldnt fix it right and went back and paid them double to re-do the job. In the process after I got my car back I noticed my hood looked funny. They broke a connector piece that holds the bumper to the frame. They refused to fix it. Power steering bad again after a second time. I attempted to sue but I wrongfully filed in greenfield when I sld of in marion.  I'm young didn't know that. All my parts and service is under warranty. So point blank they're still responsible for my car. Took it back up and they Rudely refused to do any work on my car cuz I did try and sue them. So I literally spent around $4k just for nothing.  These ppl lied to me over and over.  And they obviously don't know how to do any work. I was personally told not to go here because they would charge too much. I understood that but I  figured I'd rather go here than a old beat up service place. I figured I cld trust a dealership.  I figured I cld get the job done right.  I was wrong.

"The hotel was beautiful as we stayed there for a conference AFLV.   Wait Staff Review  The main reason I leave this bad review is because of the banquet staff. Our waitress was very rude and not accommodating. Our waitress ignored one of our members could not have asparagus or he would die. We mistakenly forgot to get a meal card for his allergy we had on file for the conference. She said he did not have a card (piece of paper) that would not allow her to make any adjustments or alternations to the meal. This is a conference of almost 5,000 ppl and not all 5,000 were at the banquet. A vegetarian plate could not be swiped out for the chicken and asparagus plate? Or a plate brought out without asparagus? This makes no sense to me. After she told us no, I asked another waiter and he explained to me no accommodations without a card because of their supervisors. He apologized but said it was not allowed (he was nice). Once our waitress saw I asked him, she scolded me and said she was my waitress and not to ask anyone else. Then proceeded NOT to attend to our table of 12 people the rest of the night. Empty water glasses and plates, were then taken up by another waiter much later. I can understand that they have certain rules placed on them by their superiors but the way she spoke to us and reacted was up acceptable. Not to mention we contacted AFLV and they said they received similar complaints from people. So JW Marriott please have a conversation with your wait staff, we can understand policy but somethings are exceptions or at least speak to people with respect.",negative,frustrated,"wait staff, allergy accommodation, service quality",3.0,JW Marriott Indianapolis,39.7663443,-86.1683755117

The filet was ordered medium rare and arrived scored and hot light pink all the way through. The salad and side were equally sub-par. Decent wine selection though they were out of my first choice.  The food here is passable, though uninspired; but, it's a steakhouse, not a chef driven establishment. No, the real failing here was the service. The table was not cleared and cleaned promptly, the food wasn't served politely or properly. A young man literally dropped my plate in front of me from across the table without saying a word.

Usually, if they haven't heard of it, they'll Google it, and then fix one for me. Nope.  But they did serve me a delicious Irish Coffee.  The entrees were the stars of the meal.

I first encountered the bar in the winter where a group of girls met and took advantage of the huge windows and comfy couches inside. The glass lamps (I am told there are 99) are breathtaking. The drinks were amazing, albeit expensive, but worth it. The servers bring truffle oil popcorn. Oh yeah. It is as good as it sounds.  I had no idea that I could like the place more until I discovered the outdoor spring/summer space.  The large outdoor area is perfect for sitting and enjoying the elements.  The view is not fabulous, but endearing.  The servers are fantastic...we soon got to know a few of them and they are so friendly and quick to greet you.  They make your experience even better.

Bathrooms: I found it amusing they went to the trouble to decoratively fold the toilet paper like a flag at Arlington, when they didn't even stock soap (had to go to front desk for that). We thought Theresa sucked, then realized it's because they were sleep number beds that you could not inflate. Front desk lady didn't even understand that there was no apparatus to inflate it. When the maintenance guy came-with hands so dirty, looked like he just crawled out of a messy turbine- he had to handle the sheets to access the air plug with the one inflating machine. Evidently, he didn't get one of the mattresses plugged back up, because it slowly deflated over night. What an absolute crap hole. We had seen online that it was recently renovated- hahaha. Maybe they have just started, but, I don't think so.  They need to replace the mattresses or get the adjusters for the sleep number back. Just to be at a base level.

"The IMA's collection rests on its chief benefactors, namely the Clowes, Lilly, Marmon and Pantzer families and their differing collecting tastes. While Indianapolis is a relatively old Midwestern city, the IMA's history is recent; it was known as the ""Art Association"" until 1969.  The recent multi-year renovation, redevelopment and expansion of the Museum and grounds created an entirely new experience for art patrons.  Let's all say our condolences to the Krannert Pavilion's Brutalist architecture of the 1970s and hello to a somewhat uninspired series of camera-ready atria that will no doubt allow some very impressive parties.  The collection itself is conservative and unprovoking.  Highlights include Robert Indiana's iconic masterwork (and trademark-infringed) ""LOVE"" painting and sculpture, a beautifully painted though incredibly ill-placed Rembrandt, a decent Hopper, an encyclopedic Asian art collection that is one of the best in the country, and the largest collection of JMW Turner drawings outside of Great Britain (although quantity does not trump quality).  I thought the gift shop was as poorly stocked as the previous one.  Not a single postcard of the new museum's exterior, yet there were plenty of old postcards showing the now-demolished Krannert Pavilion.  And for an artwork that's been copied, dubiously appropriated and downright stolen, why was there not one postcard available of Robert Indiana's outdoor ""LOVE"" sculpture?  And what about museum merchandise based off its own artwork: scarves with motif from the museum's Tiffany piece, jewelry pieces mimicking something from the Asian galleries or pop-up note cards laser-cut with the new museum facade?  Sure, all the ""LOVE"" stuff is nice, but capitalize on other museum strengths.  This is a wonderful museum that has a decent collection.  The parking is free, the new eating options are terrific, and there are other fun attractions on the museum grounds, most notably the Lilly estate, Oldfields.",positive,content,"collection, renovation, gift shop, parking",5.0,Newfields: A Place for Nature and the Arts,39.8274175724,-86.1896065943

I assumed that they would make me get all 4 tires changed (as that is typically what happens when one tire goes out at least for me) but the woman walked me through why I only need to change two of my four tires.

I sat there for 10-15 minutes just for someone to wrap a bow around the already boxed cake. I ordered the White and Black Cake. The icing was not sweet at all and it was greasy.

I'm not much for holiday spectacle-type shows, but the superb cast and great use of the stage was a pleasure. The performance was surprisingly first-rate both in acting and production quality.  I've been told IRT is one of Indy's premiere performing venues and is an equity theater, so you should expect a certain ""polish.""

"I ordered the 1st day they were open from grubhub for carryout. They accepted my order and said it was ready before I walked in. I walked into the restaurant and not only was my order not ready, but everyone who ordered at the counter getting their meal before mine, and they were getting it for half price.   I watched 9 people come in, order, and get their food before me, but pay half what I did because I ordered online. I sat there for 45 minutes despite the fact that I ordered ahead of everyone else there, paid double what they did for their food, and was confirmed that the order was ready.  I was apologized to frequently for the wait, but at no point was I offered any explanation as to why I waited 9 times longer than those ordering at the counter, or why they told grubhub it was ready, or why it was charged at twice the price as at the counter (delivered I would understand, but I picked it up).   I live a block and a half away (315 N Senate). I had hoped it would be a place that I could carry out from often, but I was thoroughly disappointed. All said, the food was OK, but the experience was absolutely horrible. Due to that experience I would recommend either Bento Asian (mostly Japanese, $2.50 delivery) or the China King at 148 N Deleware (free delivery) for Asian delivery or carry-out.

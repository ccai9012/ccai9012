"I was really between 3 and 4 stars for this one. I LOVE the 96th street Naked Tchopstix so I was very excited to see this one which is closer to my house. The vibe is totally different as this is geared more to take out although they do have a decent size dining area. You order at the counter and they deliver it. My daughter and I tried the sushi bowl. You pick up a piece of paper and  select from a choice of proteins, vegetables, rice and toppings. I like the fact that it is on paper and you don't have to guess what things are or have to shout over the counter to tell the server what you want. The sushi bowl was good but not wonderful. The choices particularly of the vegetables seemed a little too limiting and I felt I had more rice than other food items. The sauces were tasty. My husband ordered the Maui roll which is my favorite roll at the 96th street location and this just was not up that standard. It was good but the quality and consistently was not as good as at 96th street. I would go back though and I think a lot of people would be happy with the sushi bowls. I do want to make a comment about the low reviews that people have given the place because of service. People - it is a sushi place - it isn't McDonalds- so it will be a bit slower. You are not going to order and get out of there in five minutes even though it is called express. As a healthy alternative to fast food in the area, it is worth the wait. Oh and try the bubble tea. I had the strawberry and it was quite yummy. Next time I am going to try the vanilla chai.",positive,content,"sushi bowl, Maui roll, bubble tea, service, quality",4.0,Naked Tchopstix Express,39.912505,-86.211285
"I love the Brewpub for their variety of dishes.  Nachos, pizza and sandwiches.  Variety of beers to choose from crafted right on sight.    Every time we go, the service is slow.  I think it's just the pace of the restaurant.  It's never a quick beer and a bite of food.  Instead, enjoy the patio and friends, savor that time.    Kid and dog friendly environment.  Also great for your vegetarian and vegan friends.    My go to is a half order of the nachos or fish & chips.    Tried their Pumpkin Seasonal Beer and it's on par with some of my favorite pumpkins.",positive,content,"variety, service, atmosphere",4.0,Broad Ripple Brewpub,39.8735797809,-86.142783297
I stopped here because it was by the hotel I was staying in. The guys working at the shop were super nice and friendly. I really like the buy one get one deal they do. I also ordered some hot wings and they were pretty good. They had a ton of sauce on them which is awesome. Next time I come back to town I will be sure to stop here for some more pizza!,positive,content,"pizza, hot wings, deal, friendly",5.0,Just Pizza,39.7881543,-86.2116976
"Milktooth is the place to go if you want a good breakfast cocktail and a twist on traditional brunch. At first glance of the menu, you may think you've never heard of any of these foods for breakfast, and you may be right. I guarantee no matter what you order, you're going to enjoy it.   Milktooth is one of the most popular brunch places in Indy, which means you will typically have a wait. Trust me, it's worth the usual 30 minute wait (on weekends). To make it go by a little faster, they've got a walk up bar for their coffee drinks and pastries. Snack on one of those to give you a preview of the amazing meal you're about to have.  Their menu changes from time to time but they have a few things that stay one the menu but change ingredients. I love all of their variations on a Dutch pancake, and their raclette grilled cheese is to die for.  If you're making this a boozy breakfast, don't pass up on the michelada. And sit outside if it's warm enough!",positive,delighted,"brunch, menu, wait, cocktail",5.0,Milktooth,39.7591692208,-86.146494347

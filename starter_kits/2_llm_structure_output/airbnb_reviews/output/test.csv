103760,352385,2011-07-04,This apartment is in a fabulous location - walk to SoHo- and right on transport.  Place was spotlessly clean!

103760,390313,2011-07-23,"The apartment is very clean and has everything. Even the place is very small - it's the standard in HK-  but well organized. The internet connection is stable and fast. The air con and water heater work properly. The kitchen is well-equipped and there is a washing machine too. The area is safe and super convenient with Airport Express, MTR, trams, ferries and buses. H&M is just right behind the house and Tsui Wah restaurant is great, just around the corner :)<br/><br/>The only problem we had was the stairs as we had to climb up to 3rd floor with our huge luggages. But the place is worth for our stay.<br/><br/>I will stay at Brendan's apartment again for sure!",positive,"clean room, great location, well-equipped facility, responsive host, convenient transport",positive,"The area is safe and super convenient with Airport Express, MTR, trams, ferries, and buses, with H&M and Tsui Wah restaurant nearby.",positive,"The apartment is very clean, well-organized, and well-equipped with stable internet, proper air con, water heater, kitchen, and washing machine.",positive,"The guest would stay at Brendan's apartment again, indicating a positive experience with the host."

103760,322244,2011-06-19,"We had a great experience staying in this apartment in Hong Kong. Although very small, it was very clean and in a most convenient location in Central. Very quiet, good wifi and television.  Brendan also was more flexible than most hosts usually are. We needed to leave some luggage under a bed during a 4 day excursion into China, and needed to adjust our second stay in the apartment by one day due to China visa complications. Luckily no one else was staying in the apartment while we were in China, but Brendan was most kind to allow us to make the required adjustments. I would definitely recommend the apartment and host to anyone (provided they can climb a few flights of stairs as there is no elevator.) I liked the apartment experience much more than staying at an expensive hotel! The Vietnamese restaurant right next to the entrance was a great family operated  place with good, inexpensive food - wonderful after a 15 hour flight!<br/>",positive,"clean room, convenient location, flexible host, good wifi, quiet",positive,Most convenient location in Central with a great Vietnamese restaurant nearby.,positive,"Very clean, quiet, with good wifi and television, though small and no elevator.",positive,"Brendan was very flexible and kind, allowing adjustments to the stay and luggage storage."

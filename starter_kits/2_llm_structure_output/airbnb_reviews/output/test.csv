103760,352385,2011-07-04,This apartment is in a fabulous location - walk to SoHo- and right on transport.  Place was spotlessly clean!

103760,390313,2011-07-23,"The apartment is very clean and has everything. Even the place is very small - it's the standard in HK-  but well organized. The internet connection is stable and fast. The air con and water heater work properly. The kitchen is well-equipped and there is a washing machine too. The area is safe and super convenient with Airport Express, MTR, trams, ferries and buses. H&M is just right behind the house and Tsui Wah restaurant is great, just around the corner :)<br/><br/>The only problem we had was the stairs as we had to climb up to 3rd floor with our huge luggages. But the place is worth for our stay.<br/><br/>I will stay at Brendan's apartment again for sure!",positive,"clean apartment, excellent location, well-equipped kitchen, stairs access, great amenities",positive,Safe and super convenient with multiple transport options and nearby amenities,positive,"Well-organized apartment with stable internet, working appliances, and good amenities despite small size",positive,Guest expressed intention to stay at Brendan's apartment again

103760,322244,2011-06-19,"We had a great experience staying in this apartment in Hong Kong. Although very small, it was very clean and in a most convenient location in Central. Very quiet, good wifi and television.  Brendan also was more flexible than most hosts usually are. We needed to leave some luggage under a bed during a 4 day excursion into China, and needed to adjust our second stay in the apartment by one day due to China visa complications. Luckily no one else was staying in the apartment while we were in China, but Brendan was most kind to allow us to make the required adjustments. I would definitely recommend the apartment and host to anyone (provided they can climb a few flights of stairs as there is no elevator.) I liked the apartment experience much more than staying at an expensive hotel! The Vietnamese restaurant right next to the entrance was a great family operated  place with good, inexpensive food - wonderful after a 15 hour flight!<br/>",positive,"convenient location, flexible host, clean apartment, no elevator, near good restaurants",positive,Most convenient location in Central with a great Vietnamese restaurant next door,positive,"Very clean, quiet, good wifi and television, but very small and no elevator",positive,"More flexible than most hosts, kind about luggage storage and schedule adjustments"

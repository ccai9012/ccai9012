Based on the provided context, the paper applies a **multinomial logistic regression** model. 

The purpose of this model is to determine whether different movement trajectories are associated with the usage of different features in space.

Specifically:
*   **Dependent variable:** The type of trajectory (e.g., passive, playful, etc.).
*   **Independent variables:** The total duration a person spends within 0.5 meters of different types of spatial features.
*   **Reference group:** People with passive trajectories are used as the baseline for comparison.

Based on the provided context, I cannot provide a complete summary of the paper.

The excerpts contain specific data from a results section (including statistical values and odds ratios) and parts of the discussion and limitations sections. The paper appears to be a study analyzing physical activity and play behavior (using trajectory analysis) in a public open space, specifically a waterfront area.

However, the context does not include the paper's abstract, introduction, or a clear statement of its main objectives and conclusions, which are necessary for a proper summary. The authors acknowledge limitations such as the study being based on a single day's video data and not capturing less active forms of play.

| Difficulty in measuring and distinguishing playful behavior from other activities in public open spaces. | Few studies use movement trajectories to detect playful activities; existing research often focuses on classifying general movement (e.g., ""going straight"") rather than play specifically. | Analysis of anonymized video data to generate pedestrian trajectories; trajectories classified into types (Playful, Strolling, Sporty, Passive, Mixed) using indicators (detour ratio, area & ratio of min. bounding rectangle, length, duration); multinomial logistic regression to link trajectory types to interaction with site features; physical activity (MET-minutes) estimated from speed. | Different trajectory types are significantly associated with interaction durations of different site features (heart-shaped seating, bench, pavilion, waterfront); trajectory types show significant differences in the amount and intensity of physical activity (as shown in Fig. 5). |"

| Accurate and real-time object detection for applications like social distancing monitoring. | Need for robust detectors that handle occlusions, overlaps, and crowded scenes in real-world public places; Defining appropriate weights for long-term risk heat map averaging. | Proposes a YOLO-based object detection model fine-tuned on human categories from the Google Open Images dataset; Evaluated on the challenging Oxford Town Centre (OTC) dataset; System includes object detection, tracking, and a red-zone prediction algorithm for risk assessment. | The developed system successfully generates 2D and 3D violation and risk heat maps; It identifies crowded zones where social distancing is breached with a high level of confidence and accuracy; Performance is benchmarked on Precision, Recall, and FPS metrics against state-of-the-art methods. |
| Evolution of object detection models for improved speed and accuracy. | Transitioning from two-stage (region proposal-based) detectors to single-stage (unified) real-time detectors. | Various methodologies are summarized, including: Two-stage (R-CNN, Fast R-CNN, Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN); Single-stage (YOLO series, SSD, RetinaNet); Various backbones (VGG, ResNet, Darknet, CSPNet); Various necks (SPP, FPN, PAN, BiFPN). | The table provides a comprehensive list of state-of-the-art design options for CNN-based object detection models, covering input augmentation, activation functions, backbone architectures, neck modules, regularization techniques, and detection heads (both anchor-based and anchor-free). |"

| Monitoring social distancing in real-time via automated object detection and tracking. | Higher number of false positives may cause discomfort/panic; Privacy and individual rights concerns are not adequately addressed. | A framework using fine-tuned object detection models (Faster R-CNN, SSD, YOLOv3) on a dataset from Open Images and Oxford Town Center footage. People are tracked and grouped using a 3D feature space (x, y, d) and pairwise L2 norm distance. A violation index (people/groups) is calculated. | Inception v2 was identified as the most efficient backbone architecture (highest accuracy/parameter ratio). The fine-tuned models were evaluated using mAP and loss metrics. The proposed framework successfully identified social groups and calculated a violation index for monitoring. |"

| Quantifying the multifaceted concept of ""vitality"" in small public spaces is complex and lacks a systematic, high-precision data-driven framework. | Existing methods for large-scale spaces are difficult to transform for small public spaces due to low data accuracy; a more systematic representation system based on high-precision data is needed. | A computer vision-based framework to extract human trajectories from videos and calculate five quantitative indicators (number of people, duration of stay, motion speed, trajectory diversity, trajectory complexity); Stepwise multiple linear regression was used to model the relationship between these indicators and subjective expert ratings of overall vitality. | A significant multiple linear regression model was constructed (N=48, R²=.781, p<.001); The number of people (num), duration of stay (dur), trajectory diversity (TD), and trajectory complexity (TC) were all statistically significant predictors (p<.05) of overall vitality. |"

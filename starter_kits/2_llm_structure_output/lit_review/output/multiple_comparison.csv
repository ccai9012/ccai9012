| Difficulty in measuring and distinguishing playful activities from other behaviors in public open spaces; need to understand how movement patterns relate to space usage and physical activity. | Few studies measure play directly; existing research often overlooks the relationship between specific movement trajectories, interaction with site features, and resulting physical activity levels in unprogrammed public spaces. | Analysis of anonymized video data from a harbourfront space; generation of pedestrian trajectories tracked for ≥25s; classification into types (Playful, Strolling, Sporty, Passive, Mixed) using indicators (detour ratio, bounding box area/ratio, trajectory length/duration); multinomial logistic regression to link trajectory types to feature interaction; estimation of physical activity (MET-minutes) from speed. | Playful trajectories are associated with interaction with specific site features (heart-shaped seating, benches, pavilion); different trajectory types exhibit significantly different levels of physical activity (Sporty trajectories have the highest MET-minutes); the method successfully uses movement trajectories to classify behavior and measure play and physical activity in a public space. |"

| Developing a vision-based system for monitoring social distancing and assessing critical density/risk of infection spread, particularly for COVID-19. | How to define appropriate averaging weights and coefficients for long-term risk heat maps (crowd maps); Normalization of risk maps over time. | An AI and Computer Vision methodology involving a CNN-based object detection model (fine-tuned on human categories from Google Open Images) for people detection, followed by tracking and a red-zone prediction algorithm to generate 2D/3D violation and risk heat maps. | The system successfully identified crowded zones with social distancing breaches and areas with minimal risk on the Oxford Town Centre (OTC) dataset; The proposed method is feasible for social distancing monitoring and risk assessment with high confidence and accuracy. |
| Achieving optimal speed and accuracy for real-time object detection. | Improving upon previous object detection architectures for better performance. | Proposes YOLOv4, a CNN-based object detector with an optimized architecture focusing on input augmentations, backbone feature extraction, neck design, and head prediction. | YOLOv4 is presented as achieving state-of-the-art optimal speed and accuracy for object detection. |
| Enabling real-time object detection with a unified, single-stage model. | Overcoming the complexity and speed limitations of two-stage detectors (e.g., R-CNN series). | Proposes YOLO (You Only Look Once), a unified architecture that frames object detection as a single regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and class probabilities. | YOLO enables real-time, unified object detection. |
| Improving the speed and performance of two-stage object detectors. | The computational bottleneck of generating region proposals in Fast R-CNN. | Introduces Faster R-CNN, which uses a Region Proposal Network (RPN) to generate proposals directly from the feature map, sharing convolutional features with the detection network. | Enables real-time object detection with a region proposal network; Towards real-time performance. |
| Addressing class imbalance in dense object detection. | The class imbalance problem encountered during training of one-stage detectors, where easy negative examples dominate the loss. | Proposes RetinaNet and a novel Focal Loss function that applies a modulating term to the cross entropy loss to focus learning on hard negative examples. | Focal loss enables one-stage detectors to achieve accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art two-stage detectors. |"

| Monitoring social distancing in public spaces via surveillance footage. | The need for an efficient, real-time framework that balances accuracy and speed for practical deployment; addressing privacy concerns and higher false positives. | A deep learning framework combining fine-tuned object detection models (Faster RCNN, SSD, YOLO v3) with a tracking algorithm. Uses anchor boxes for detection and Mahalanobis/cosine distance for tracking. Social groups are identified using L2 norm on a 3D feature space (x, y, d). | Models were trained on a filtered ""Person"" class dataset from Open Images; Inception v2 was identified as an efficient backbone for Faster RCNN/SSD due to its high accuracy-to-parameters ratio; the framework outputs color-coded groups and a violation index (people/groups). |"

| Quantifying the vitality of small public spaces in a systematic and human-oriented way. | Existing methods (e.g., for large-scale spaces) have low data accuracy for small public spaces; a need for a high-precision, multifaceted vitality representation system. | A computer vision-based framework to extract human trajectories from videos and calculate five quantitative indicators (number of people, duration of stay, motion speed, trajectory diversity, trajectory complexity); Stepwise multiple linear regression to model the relationship between indicators and expert-rated overall vitality scores. | A significant regression model was found (N=48, R²=.781, p<.001). Key predictors of vitality were: number of people (β=.582, p<.001); duration of stay (β=.254, p=.001); trajectory diversity (β=.307, p=.004); trajectory complexity (β=.159, p=.034). Motion speed was not a significant predictor in the final model. |"

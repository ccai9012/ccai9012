# CCAI9012 Course Material and Toolkits

Artificial Intelligence is rapidly reshaping how we think, create, and solve problems across disciplines. From automation to creative expression, AI is transforming not only industries but also the way we engage with the world around us. This course explores AI as a tool for critical inquiry, design thinking, and communication—especially in the context of urban life and the built environment.

In this repository, you'll find a comprehensive set of resources, including weekly course materials and project starter kits, designed to help you harness the power of AI in your work.
